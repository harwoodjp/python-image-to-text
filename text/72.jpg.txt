THE RETURN OF THE REPRESSED

So much has changed / perhaps the message is instability / permanent instability in the mind /
corresponding to the permanent revolution in things / instability to be accepted as an eternal
truth / like Heraclitean flux — But in this Heraclitean flux / or fire, there is for me also a
Heraclitean Logos / the logos, the word, is One, or oneness / unity / unification / the unification
of the human race. Logos seeks unification; and the fact it faces is Division — Alienation, in the
old Marxist vocabulary / the rents, the splits, in the newer Freudian vocabulary / the schisms /
the schizophrenia. Now — if | may make a Great Leap Forward — alienation is schizophrenia. The
outcome of the collision between Marx and Freud is their unification / the perception of the
analogy between the two / the analogy between social and psychic / society and soul / body and
body politic.

In the mythology of Marxism, the revolution is from below: Those lower classes, lower
depths, are the depths of depth psychology / an underworld repressed by the bourgeois ego /
a cauldron of energy and violence with the lid on / an anonymous mass, or social id — If you
take the psychoanalytical idea of projection seriously / the proletariat (if and when we perceive
one) is us projected / a collective projection / a collective dream, or nightmare. If you take the
psychoanalytical idea of projection seriously / the ego constructs itself by projecting the other
/ the ego constructs itself by drawing an imaginary line / between inside and outside / an
imaginary boundary-line. And this imaginary boundary-line is the reality-principle. The reality-
principle is the distinction between inner world and external reality / And it is a false distinction.
‘The False reality-principle’ / This is to take psychoanalysis more seriously than the
psychoanalysts do / or to pass beyond psychoanalysis / Beyond the reality principle is poetry
/ taking metaphors seriously / (metaphors and analogies) / that way madness lies.

The disintegration of the boundary-line / between inner and outer / self and other / is the
disintegration of the ego / the disintegration of the ego of the ego-psychologists / in Marxist
terms, the disintegration of the bourgeois ego / of bourgeois individualism / or, alienation
overcome — The split between inside and outside / is the primal split / is the origin of alienation.
Already in Marxism / the intellectual was to go to the masses / bourgeois individualism, the
separate self, was to be drowned in the proletarian ocean / Marxist thought substitutes for the
reality of individuals / the reality of classes / but classes, as external realities, mutually external,
are not real either. It all really takes place in one body. Marx, who like Freud, is a genius who
surpasses his own limitations, once said: “The head of this emancipation is philosophy, its
heart the proletariat.” He means ego and id. Of course proletariat, if you look at the word, must
also be genital. At any rate, it all takes place in one body / one body that has been mysteriously
dismembered / and needs to be remembered / to knit again these broken limbs into one body.
It must be some kind of embrace / overcoming alienation. Emerson used to say, There is only
one Man — After Emerson, what happened, on the American continent, to this intuition? To
perceive that it all really takes place in one body / is to transvalue the old political categories /
to pass from politics to metapolitics / or poetry. The proletariat is dead / but the proletariat is us
/ long live the proletariat.

There is an inner Bastille to be captured / to release the prisoners / or rather, the inner
and the outer Bastille is the same Bastille / or rather, the distinction between inner and outer is
the Bastille / the false reality-principle / the government of the reality principle / to be
overthrown / and the revolution is a visionary break-through / or poetry / or madness.
Revolution really is madness / political revolutions / The French Revolution, the Russian
Revolution / Ten Days that Shook the World / The Great Cultural Revolution / all the pathology
of the 20th century / the madness of the millennia breaking out, as Nietzsche prophesied — The
problem really is madness / There is a point where Marat and Sade are one. What to do with
madness / The political solution to the problem of madness is / divide and conquer /
segregation and repression (like in asylums) / perpetual conflict / The political revolution is a
temporary break-down / followed by the reinstitution of repression / a cycle of explosion and
repression / activity and passivity / in external recurrence / Perpetual conflict is the rule of
