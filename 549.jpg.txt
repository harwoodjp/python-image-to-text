ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 549

idea of alienation and reification emphasizes, above all, how
the alienated creations, relations, things, arise on a definite level
from the complex of the cooperation of social individuals,
whereas the conception of things’ and relations’ personification
stresses the influence of these alienated and reified connections
on the individual. It is then a conception of the socially condi-
tioned behavior of an individual, the conception of his social
motivation, his social roles and qualities. The objections against
Marx that he is not keeping the individual in view, are partly
correct, in that in the frame of the alienated, reified world,
where people are mainly and primarily the bearers of roles and
character masks, there is no question of the real, and more
precisely, the right, individual. Most relations which man lives
in are not active demonstrations of a real individual life in
the alienated and reified society. What they really are is mostly
not established by their own individuality. Social forces, as
the result of collective cooperation, are alienated or, on the
contrary, appropriated by individuals in this society. Social
power as a social product becomes private power of the private
person. The society of finance, however, the world of monetary
marketing relations, is in Marx’s conception a universal con-
fusion and disorder of everything, ie., a reversed world, a con-
fusion and mess of all natural and human qualities (author's
emphasis), It is a world where “individual behaviour returns to
its antithesis, to material behaviour.” It is the supremacy of
social over personal might, the rule of the reified relations over
the individual, oppression of the individual by accidental char-
acter. The process in which private persons appropriate alienated
social powers, personify them and play a certain part with the
appropriate character masks, is lawfully determined by a given
social structure, although chance occupies a considerable place in
it, It is possible to seize the alienated social capacities and dispose
of them perhaps in the case of inheritance, absolutely without any
action, or to catch the alienated forces of the political power with
a certain activity, but this activity is not proportionate to the
